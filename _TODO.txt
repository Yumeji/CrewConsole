Original Idea: - Crew Console
It will be an object found at the outpost, but only "unlockable" after the Hylotl mission. You will be given a quest to gather some materials and, after that, it will spawn a new npc at the outpost, the "Crew Master", and his project, the Crew Console, that he started on Earth will be working. It will be able to do 2 separate things : manage the Crew members individual outfits and searching new crew members {you actually create them from A to Z, giving also their names and jobs}. You will have to pay this service, and it will be calculated by he's/her's job.

For the first one, the one that Esther wants you to scan the paper, it may just be "Hey, one of my old friend let a note on the wall of his room, could you check it?" or something like that(edited)
For the one after, just something like "To repair and power my project that I had back on Earth, I'll need -need to think about what items it'll need-. Could you bring me that? Thanks."
And for the last one we need to finish the interface and all that kind of stuff before thinking about that
But sorry, I won't continue tonight, my eyes are burning, sorry {I've a bad eye sight, 2,25/10 and 2,5/10, standing behind a computer too late the night is not good for me}
