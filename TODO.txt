Original Idea: - Crew Console
It will be an object found at the outpost, but only "unlockable" after the Hylotl mission. You will be given a quest to gather some materials and, after that, it will spawn a new npc at the outpost, the "Crew Master", and his project, the Crew Console, that he started on Earth will be working. It will be able to do 2 separate things : manage the Crew members individual outfits and searching new crew members {you actually create them from A to Z, giving also their names and jobs}. You will have to pay this service, and it will be calculated by he's/her's job.

		Completed quest line: 
			Haha! Works better than I originally thought. To keep it simple, you can fill out a form and my device will find that person for you. Wonderful little gadget isn't it?
		Requirements to gather:

The Bulk of the difficulty will come from the selection and assignment of clothing to the crew member while 'graduating' them.
